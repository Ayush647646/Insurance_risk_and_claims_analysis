# 🚗 Insurance Risk & Claims Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing **insurance policies and claims data** to identify risk factors, customer behavior, and claim patterns.  
Using **Power BI**, I created an interactive dashboard that helps insurers make **data-driven decisions** for pricing, risk profiling, and fraud detection.

## 📊 Business Problem
Insurance companies struggle with scattered policyholder and claims data, making it difficult to:
- Understand customer segments  
- Detect high-risk groups  
- Track claims and policy distribution  
- Optimize premiums and reduce fraud  

This project solves that problem by providing a **centralized, interactive dashboard**.

---

## 📂 Dataset & Domain
The dataset contains details about **policyholders, vehicles, and claims**:

- **Demographics:** Age, Gender, Education, Marital Status, Parent/Kids Driving, Household Income  
- **Vehicle Details:** Car Make, Model, Year, Color, Use Type, Coverage Zone  
- **Claims Information:** Claim Frequency, Claim Amount, Average Claim Amount  

The domain document defines each field and its business relevance.
